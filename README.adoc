# What is it
> Assign jobs to workers and write the information who is doing when which job as ics file

The project was intended to have jobs, which must be assigned to a group of people. This will be done by
round robin.
The jobs can be configured, when they have to be done.
If the workers are on holiday on their specific time they won't re-work the missing work. This is done
because we do not struggle the work order of the people.

## Features

* see cli below
* caution the csv files are expected to always start with a headline, this first line is always ignored!

### jobDescriptions
see link:jobService/src/test/resources/WithPostProcessing/inputData/JobDescription.csv[JobDescription.csv]
```
name,startDayOfWeek(mo=1,...,sun=7),duration,begin,end,moveInfoToThisDay (off=0, mo=1,...,sun=7)
Breakfast,1, 5,09.01.2017,01.06.2017,7
Lunch,1 2 3 4 5, 1,11.01.2017,01.06.2017,0
Cleaning,1, 2,23.01.2017,01.06.2017,6
```
If you want to move the weekly information of a job to another day this is the
moveInfoToDay column.
For example you want to have breakfast the whole week and want to move the information to sunday.
This is done because of better layout in the end.

./gradlew build
ls -al build/libs/
```

## Post processing

link:https://www.w3.org/Tools/Ical2html/[ical2html original] or link:https://github.com/rogerGunis/ical2html[ical2html modified from me]

## Travis
In link:.travis.yml[travis.yml] you will see a full compile and deployment of the example above.
Additionally there is a configuration for pushing the calculated ics file to a dedicated server (owncloud)
updating the calendar automatically.

The link:jobService/src/test/resources/WithPostProcessing/bin/IcsFileSync.sh[IcsFileSync.sh] will check previously deployed entries
delete them and add new events. Changed calendar entries will not be removed and stay in the calendar.
