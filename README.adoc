> Assign jobs to workers and write the information who is doing when which job as ics file

The project was intended to have jobs, which must be assigned to a group of people. This will be done by
round robin.
The jobs can be configured, when they have to be done.
If the workers are on holiday on their specific time they won't re-work the missing work. This is done
because we do not struggle the work order of the people.
